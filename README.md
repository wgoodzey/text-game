# Text Adventure Game

This is a C++ project that is designed to load a world from a TXT file, parsing
room data such as title, description, as well as adjacent rooms. The world
files follow the following format:

```txt
ROOM 1
NAME Front Yard
DESC A grassy yard with a sturdy tree in the center. A wooden treehouse peeks out from the branches.
EXIT NORTH 2 UP 4
```

All fields are single lines (DO NOT USE NEW LINES). Fields include `ROOM`
number (room id) `NAME`, `DESC`, and `EXIT`. For exits have the direction in
all capital letters followed by the target room ID number. To have multiple
exits for a room, separate with spaces.
